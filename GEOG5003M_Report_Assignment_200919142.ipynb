        "# 6.0 Interpretation\n",
        "There is a parabolic relationship between affordable housing and residential sales. Councils with both many and few affordable homes had low sales, while those with the highest sales had only a modest number. In historic industrialised areas (e.g. Leeds), it was necessary to attract many workers to live there, and higher wages combine with a large buyers’ market. In smaller, wealthy, fast-growing economies (e.g. York, which also benefits from preserving its antiquity), have not needed many affordable homes. This raises prices and reduces affordability and sales. In poorer areas (e.g. Bradford), there is a need for affordable housing, but it is less profitable for housing associations. There is a taboo around new residents moving to previously impoverished city centres, particularly with wealthier suburbs. However, it is improving the living conditions for these areas’ existing residents, with a large supply of affordable homes and a local need for them, that the public benefit can be most.\n"
